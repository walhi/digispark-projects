# Keyboard

A USB VIM Pedal keyboard example. Pressing a button generates a keystroke "i", releasing generates a keystroke "ESC".

## Hardware

A 10 kÎ© resistor between PB2 pin and VCC is required. Button (normally open) connects to pin PB2 and GND.


## Usage

Build the program and flash it as usual to the digispark.

```bash
$ make clean && make
$ make upload
```

You can reboot the device for reflash by turning on the caps lock indicator more than five times.

After the program loads, you should see a new USB device:

```bash
$ lsusb
Bus 111 Device 222: ID 4242:e131 USB Design by Example
```

dmesg will also show the new keyboard:

```bash
$ dmesg | tail

```

The canonical LED toggle is now controlled by the Caps Lock key!
